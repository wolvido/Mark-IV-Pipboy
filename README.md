Completely static website that partially replicates the Mark IV Pip-Boy from Fallout using BEM methodology, focusing on front-end development skills.
Featuring the unique Pip-Boy Mark IV design and partial interactive elements and dynamic features.

### Note:
The Map, Radio, and Data sections are not implemented as they required functionality beyond the scope of a static website. It was a fun exercise for me to explore the challenge of recreating its unique CRT screen design without committing to the complexity of a fully functional backend implementation.
